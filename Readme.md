## Running the Application

### Development Mode

1. **Start the Express Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Express server using `nodemon`, which automatically restarts the server on code changes.

2. **Start the React Application:**

   Open a new terminal and run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React development server.

3. **Access the Application:**
